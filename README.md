## Code Explanations and Sources

**SCSS**
SCSS uses the 7-1 folder structure for organisation 
[Source for 7-1 Folder Structure](https://itnext.io/structuring-your-sass-projects-c8d41fa55ed4)
[Source for setting angular project up for SCSS without relying on the CLI](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-structure-scss-in-an-angular-app-a1b8a759a028)
[Whether or not to use a CSS reset](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/should-you-reset-your-css/)

CSS reset should not be relied upon but should be ok for smaller projects especially when you dont have to worry too much about older or niche browser versions.

Going to start off by using meyer's reset but attempt to replace it with one of my own later on as the browser specific css becomes more familiar
